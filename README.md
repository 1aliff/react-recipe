# [Live Site](https://epic-bohr-fa9580.netlify.app/)

Build and deployed to Netlify with hidden API key.
Noted that this is a free api given by Edamam. So it has a request limitation per minute. Please give it a time to reload within 5-10 minutes or so.


# About this project

Recipe App build with React and Material UI. API provided by [Edamam](www.edamam.com) - you may go through the documentations there on how can we consume the API there.

I created this recipe app for my own learning purposes. There are a lot of rooms to improve (flaws included). Currently it is still work in progress. I will try to constantly update, re-factor and write cleaner code next time.

Thanks for viewing.

# Available Scripts

In order for this to work for you, you may need to register to edamam to get your own `APP_ID` and `APP_KEY` as i already hide my own. Then you should replace my current one in my `App.js`

Once complete, you may clone this repo and run:

`npm install`

and then run

`npm start`

and you should be good to go.
